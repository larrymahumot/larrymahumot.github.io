## If you don't want to download an archive you can use GitHub Pages to render this.

Fork the repository to your account.
Clone it locally on your machine
Create a `gh-pages` branch (if one already exists, remove it and create a new one based off `master`).
Push the branch back to GitHub.
View the pages at `http://username.github.io/repo`
In code:

```
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
cd repo
git branch gh-pages
# Might need to do this first: git branch -D gh-pages
git push -u origin gh-pages # Push the new branch back to github
Go to http://username.github.io/repo
```
